# WeSTEM Web Page Revival 
Nouf and Ivana and Yeonie got are the web team for 2021 - 2022. We are reviving an outdated website after three years of inactivity to serve as a point of contact and a resource hub for the SIG. Upon taking up this role, we found that all people who had worked on the website in 2018 had graduated. The prevous code was seldomly commented and we were getting lost in the github folder too. 

That is why will be welcoming new team members to our team in Spring 2022 to ensure transition. We are self-teaching this all on our own.
